# hello-world
This repository is majorly for my talking about what I have learnt so far about Github.
I'm a Human resource manager with interest in tech companies. I enjoy working with Software developers and making sure I create an atmosphere to work with them.
I have been working with developers for the past three years and it's been a great journey.
